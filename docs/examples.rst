Examples
========

In this section we display small examples to show what a bot written with
``python-telegram-bot`` looks like.
Some bots focus on one specific
aspect of the Telegram Bot API while others focus on one of the
mechanics of this library.

All examples are licensed under the `CC0

and are therefore fully dedicated to the public domain. You can use them
as the base for your own bots without worrying about copyrights.

This is the base example of how to use PTBtest to write unit tests for your 
``python-telegram-bot``. It is based on `echobot <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/examples/echobot.py>`__
which simply replies to each text message with a message that contains the same text.
