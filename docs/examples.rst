Examples
========

Here are some small examples to show how a developer can user ``PTBtest`` to write
unit tests for a ``python-telegram-bot`` bot.

All examples are licensed under the `CC0

and are therefore fully dedicated to the public domain. You can use them
as the base for your own bots without worrying about copyrights.

:any:`examples.test_echobot`
----------------------------

This is the base example of how to use PTBtest to write unit tests for your 
``python-telegram-bot``. It is based on `echobot <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/examples/echobot.py>`__
which simply replies to each text message with a message that contains the same text.

:any:`examples.test_timerbot`
-----------------------------

This example follows the timerbot example at: `timerbot <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/examples/timerbot.py>`__.
We will skip the start and help handlers and focus on the timer.
