PTBtest
=======

.. note::

   This application is under active development.

Developing bots for Telegram is fun. With *Python Telegram Bot* it's a breeze. But there's a thing. Writing tests for the application can be cumbersome, because of the live API calls (slow, unreliable and dependent on network availability). So, **PTBtest** for the rescue. 

**PTBtest** lets you test your code in isolation, ensuring predictable and repeatable results without relying on an active internet connection. By simulating responses from Telegram's API, it enables robust test coverage while reducing external dependencies.
